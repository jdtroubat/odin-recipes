    <!--Recipe-->
    <p><h2>Description:</h2></p>
    <p>The Denver omelet is a change of pace from a French omelet and is known for its firmer texture and caramelized flavor.</br>
       It's one of the first foods I learned to cook professionally as a line cook in high school.</br>
       Make it a complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.</p>
    <!--Ingredients-->
    <p><h3>Ingredients:</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 larges eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup diced smoked ham</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <!--Steps-->
    <p><h3>Steps:</h3></p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</p></li>

                <li><p>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat.</br>
                    Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt and pepper.</br>
                    Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</p></li>

                <li><p>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs.</br>
                    Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed.</br>
                    Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet.</br> 
                    Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet.</p></li>

                <li><p>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes.</br>
                    Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate.</p></li>
            </ol>
